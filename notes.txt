File Explanations:
    MyContext.cs
        -"Once you have all your models created, there is one more model we need to make in our Models folder.
         This is our context file. The context class is what forms the relationship between our models and the
         database. Think of it as an object that sits between our app and the database that translates our
         queries for us. Context classes, by convention, always have names that end in "Context". You can name
         the file anything (though something informative is your best option), just remember to add "Context"
         to the end!"
